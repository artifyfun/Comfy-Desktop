/**
 * Distribution display + install-state policy: the UI layer, NOT the library.
 *
 * The comfy-builder library gives raw distributions / versions / artifacts and a
 * pure host-matcher (`selectArtifactForHost`). This module applies the product
 * policy on top: for each distribution it resolves the latest COMPLETE version,
 * asks whether an artifact exists for THIS host, and flattens that into a single
 * renderer-safe display row (`installable` / `no-build` / `platform-mismatch`).
 * The renderer renders the row and, on click, asks main to install by id: the
 * chosen artifact (and its download ref) never leaves the main process.
 *
 * `update-available` also lives here: given the installed version (passed in by
 * the handler from the installations store), a row whose newer complete version
 * has a host-runnable artifact is marked updatable. Plain `installed` (up to date)
 * stays a renderer concern: it de-dupes those tiles out of the grid.
